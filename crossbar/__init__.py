    **Examples**

    To start Crossbar.io programmatically from a given node directory:

    .. code-block:: python

        import crossbar

        crossbar.run(['start', '--cbdir', '/tmp/mynode1/.crossbar'])

    To start Crossbar.io with log output at level "debug"

    .. code-block:: console

        $ crossbar start --loglevel=debug

    To chose a specific event reactor and print version information

    .. code-block:: console

        $ CROSSBAR_REACTOR="kqueue" crossbar version

    To start from a specified node directory (instead of the default `$CWD/.crossbar`):

    .. code-block:: console

        $ CROSSBAR_DIR="/tmp/test/.crossbar" crossbar start

    which is the same as

    .. code-block:: console

        $ crossbar start --cbdir=/tmp/test/.crossbar
