Programming Guide
=================

Programming WAMP application components is tied to the particular client
library you're using. The `Autobahn </autobahn>`__ family of WAMP client
libraries is provided by us, whereas you can find more WAMP client
libraries `here <http://wamp.ws/implementations/#libraries>`__.

We also operate a public `Crossbar.io Demo Instance <Demo%20Instance>`__
and offer a range of materials for `IoT devices, components and
applications <http://crossbario.com/iotcookbook>`__.

    For administrators, we provide a `Administration
    Manual <Administration>`__ that provides documentation about
    administration aspects related to Crossbar.io.

The following introduces different areas of WAMP application programming
with Crossbar.io:

Specific Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Details of programming depend on the `specific WAMP
library </about/Supported-Languages/>`__ you are using. You may find
more information in the documentation for the respective libraries, e.g.

-  `Programming with
   Autobahn\|Python <http://autobahn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wamp/programming.html>`__
-  `Programming with
   Autobahn\|JavaScript <https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js/blob/master/doc/programming.md>`__
