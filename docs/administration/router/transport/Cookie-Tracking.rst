title: Cookie Tracking toc: [Documentation, Administration, Router
Transports, WebSocket Transport, Cookie Tracking]

Cookie Tracking
===============

Cookie tracking identifies and tracks WAMP-over-WebSocket client
connections using HTTP cookies.

Cookie tracking can be enabled on `WebSocket- <WebSocket-Transport>`__
and `Web-Transport <Web-Transport-and-Services>`__. It is not available
on other transport types such as `RawSocket <RawSocket-Transport>`__.

    While enabling cookie tracking is a prerequisite for cookie-based
    WAMP authentication, it can be used without authentication.

How it works
------------

Cookie tracking is backed by a configurable cookie store. Currently we
have two types of store:

-  memory-backed
-  file-backed

    In the future, we'll have an LMDB backed cookie store as well.

The stored information for a cookie includes the cookie ID as well as
authentication information (see `Cookie
Authentication <Cookie-Authentication>`__).

With a memory-backed cookie store, cookies are stored in in-memory
objects, and, obviously, those cookies will be gone after stopping
Crossbar.io

With a file-backed cookie store, cookies are stored in an append-only,
on-disk file.

Cookie Tracking without Authentication
--------------------------------------

Cookie tracking can be enabled without using cookie-based authentication
as well.

This is the case when

1. no authentication is configured at all
2. only anonymous authentication is configured
3. only non-cookie based authentication is configured

With 1) and 2) and cookie tracking enabled, Crossbar.io will
automatically use the cookie ID as the authentication ID (``authid``)
for the client.

This way, you still can **identify** clients across reconnects using
WAMP ``authid``. Without cookies, in case of 1) and 2), a WAMP client
will get a random ``authid`` **each time** it connects.

On the other hand, with 3), the authentication ID (``authid``) still
comes from the respective authentication method used.

Cookie Tracking with Authentication
-----------------------------------

Please see `Cookie Authentication <Cookie-Authentication>`__.

Examples
--------

To configure a memory-backed cookie store:

.. code:: json

    {
             "transports": [
                {
                   "type": "web",
                   "endpoint": {
                      "type": "tcp",
                      "port": 8080
                   },
                   "paths": {
                      "/": {
                         "type": "static",
                         "directory": "../web"
                      },
                      "ws": {
                         "type": "websocket",
                         "cookie": {
                            "name": "cbtid",
                            "length": 24,
                            "max_age": 864000,
                            "store": {
                               "type": "memory"
                            }
                         }
                      }
                   }
                }
             ]
    }

To configure a file-backed cookie store:

.. code:: json

    {
             "transports": [
                {
                   "type": "web",
                   "endpoint": {
                      "type": "tcp",
                      "port": 8080
                   },
                   "paths": {
                      "/": {
                         "type": "static",
                         "directory": "../web"
                      },
                      "ws": {
                         "type": "websocket",
                         "cookie": {
                            "name": "cbtid",
                            "length": 24,
                            "max_age": 864000,
                            "store": {
                               "type": "file",
                               "filename": "cookies.dat"
                            }
                         }
                      }
                   }
                }
             ]
    }

In above example, the cookie store would reside in
``.crossbar/cookies.dat`` for a default node directory.

    Note that the cookie file is "growing forever". There is no purging
    whatsoever, as the file is written append-only. The LMDB cookie
    store will provide a more advanced store.
