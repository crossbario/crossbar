WebSocket Transport
===================

Quick Links: **`WebSocket Options <WebSocket%20Options>`__** -
**`WebSocket Compression <WebSocket%20Compression>`__** - **`Cookie
Tracking <Cookie%20Tracking>`__** - **`Transport
Endpoints <Transport%20Endpoints>`__**

The **WebSocket Transport** is the default and most common way for
running WAMP. In particular, WAMP-over-WebSocket is the protocol used to
communicate with browsers that natively support WebSocket.

Crossbar.io supports all the favors of WAMP-over-WebSocket, including
different serialization formats (JSON and MsgPack) as well as
**listening transports**

-  `Listening WebSocket Transport
   Configuration <#listening-transports>`__
-  `Listening WebSocket Transport
   Example <#example---listening-transport>`__

as well as **connecting transports**

-  `Connecting WebSocket Transport
   Configuration <#connecting-transports>`__
-  `Connecting WebSocket Transport
   Example <#example---connecting-transport>`__

    The difference between the WebSocket Transport here, and the
    `WebSocket Service <WebSocket%20Service>`__, which is a feature of
    the `Web Transport <Web%20Transport%20and%20Services>`__ is that the
    transport here is **only** able to serve WAMP-over-WebSocket and
    nothing else, whereas the Web Transport allows to combine multiple
    Web services all running on one port.

Configuration
-------------

Crossbar.io supports both **listening** as well as **connecting**
WAMP-over-WebSocket transports.

Listening transports are used with `routers <Router%20Configuration>`__
to allow WAMP clients connect to Crossbar.io, whereas connecting
transports are used with `containers <Container%20Configuration>`__ to
allow hosted components to connect to their upstream router.

Listening Transports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Listening transports are used with `routers <Router%20Configuration>`__
to allow WAMP clients connect to Crossbar.io. The available parameters
for WebSocket listening transports are:

In addition to running a listening WAMP-over-WebSocket *Endpoint* on its
own port, an *Endpoint* can share a listening port with a *Web
Transport*. For more information on this, take a look at [[Web Transport
and Services]].

Example
-------

Example - Listening Transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To expose its WAMP routing services you can run an *Endpoint* that talks
WAMP-over-WebSocket. Here is an example (part of a Crossbar.io
configuration):

.. code:: javascript

    {
       "type": "websocket",
       "endpoint": {
          "type": "tcp",
          "port": 8080
       }
    }
