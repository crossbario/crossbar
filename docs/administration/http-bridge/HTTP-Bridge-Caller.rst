HTTP Bridge Caller
==================

Introduction
------------

    The *HTTP Caller* feature is available starting with Crossbar
    **0.10.3**.

The *HTTP Caller* is a service that allows clients to perform WAMP calls
via HTTP/POST requests. Crossbar will forward the call to the performing
server and return the result.

Try it
------

Clone the `Crossbar.io examples
repository <https://github.com/crossbario/crossbarexamples>`__, and go
to the ``rest/caller`` subdirectory.

Now start Crossbar:

.. code:: console

    crossbar start

This will register a simple procedure that takes two integers, adds them
together, and returns the result.

To test this out, you can use `curl <http://curl.haxx.se/>`__:

.. code:: console

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"procedure": "com.example.add2", "args": [1, 2]}' \
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/call

...or any other HTTP/POST capable tool or library.

Configuration
-------------

The *HTTP Caller* is configured on a path of a Web transport - here is
part of a Crossbar configuration:

.. code:: javascript

    {
       "workers": [
          {
             "type": "router",
             ...
             "transports": [
                {
                   "type": "web",
                   ...
                   "paths": {
                      ...
                      "call": {
                         "type": "caller",
                         "realm": "realm1",
                         "role": "anonymous"
                      }
                   }
                }
             ]
          }
       ]
    }

The service dictionary has the following parameters:

Making Requests
---------------

To call WAMP procedures through Crossbar, issue a HTTP/POST request to
the URL of the Crossbar HTTP Caller service with:

1. Content type ``application/json``
2. Body containing a JSON object
3. Two query parameters: ``timestamp`` and ``seq``

For a call to a HTTP Caller service, the body MUST be a JSON object with
the following attributes:

-  ``procedure``: A string with the URI of the procedure to call.
-  ``args``: An (optional) list of positional event payload arguments.
-  ``kwargs``: An (optional) dictionary of keyword event payload
   arguments.

Signed Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Signed requests work like unsigned requests, but have the following
additional query parameters. All query parameters (below and above) are
mandatory for signed requests.

-  ``key``: The key to be used for computing the signature.
-  ``nonce``: A random integer from [0, 2^53]
-  ``signature``: See below.

The signature computed as the Base64 encoding of the following value:

::

    HMAC[SHA256]_{secret} (key | timestamp | seq | nonce | body)

Here, ``secret`` is the secret shared between the publishing application
and Crossbar. This value will never travel over the wire.

The **HMAC[SHA256]** is computed w.r.t. the ``secret``, and over the
concatenation

::

    key | timestamp | seq | nonce | body

The ``body`` is the JSON serialized event. You can look at working code
`here <https://github.com/crossbario/crossbarconnect/blob/master/python/lib/crossbarconnect/client.py#L197>`__.
