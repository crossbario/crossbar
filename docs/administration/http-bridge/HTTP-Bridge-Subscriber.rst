HTTP Bridge Subscriber
======================

Introduction
------------

    The *HTTP Subscriber* feature is available starting with Crossbar
    **0.10.3**.

The *HTTP Subscriber* is a service that forwards PubSub events to HTTP
endpoints.

Try it
------

Clone the `Crossbar.io examples
repository <https://github.com/crossbario/crossbarexamples>`__, and go
to the ``rest/subscriber`` subdirectory.

Now start Crossbar:

.. code:: console

    crossbar start

This example is configured to subscribe all events sent to the
``com.myapp.topic1`` topic to ``httpbin.org/post``. If you publish a
message using the `HTTP Publisher <HTTP%20Bridge%20Publisher>`__
configured in the example, it will forward the message and print the
response of the message in Crossbar's debug log:

.. code:: shell

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"topic": "com.myapp.topic1", "args": ["Hello, world"]}' \
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/publish

Configuration
-------------

The *HTTP Subscriber* is configured as a WAMP component. Here it is as
part of a Crossbar configuration:

.. code:: javascript

    {
        "workers": [
            {
                "type": "container",
                "options": {
                    "pythonpath": [".."]
                },
                "components": [
                    {
                        "type": "class",
                        "classname": "crossbar.adapter.rest.MessageForwarder",
                        "realm": "realm1",
                        "extra": {
                            "subscriptions": [
                                {"url": "https://httpbin.org/post",
                                 "topic": "com.myapp.topic1"}
                            ],
                            "method": "POST",
                            "expectedcode": 200,
                            "debug": true
                        },
                        "transport": {
                            "type": "websocket",
                            "endpoint": {
                                "type": "tcp",
                                "host": "127.0.0.1",
                                "port": 8080
                            },
                            "url": "ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

The subscriber is configured through the ``extra`` dictionary:

Handling Forwarded Events
-------------------------

The Subscriber, upon recieving a PubSub event that it has been
configured to subscribe to, will send a request to the URL associated
with the topic. The body will be a JSON encoded dictionary and contain
two keys, ``"args"`` and ``"kwargs"`` from the PubSub event. Here is an
example Flask application that prints the pubsub event to the terminal:

.. code:: python

    import json
    from flask import Flask, request
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/", methods=["POST"])
    def message():
        body = json.loads(request.get_data())
        print("args:", body["args"], "kwargs:", body["kwargs"])
        return b"OK"

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

When this server is started, Crossbar is configured to forward the event
to it, and the example event at the top of the page is published, you
should see:

.. code:: console

    $ python ~/example.py
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ('args:', [u'Hello, world'], 'kwargs:', {})
    127.0.0.1 - - [21/Apr/2015 21:01:05] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
