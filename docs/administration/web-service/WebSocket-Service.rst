WebSocket Service
=================

Quick Links: **`WebSocket Options <WebSocket%20Options>`__** -

Tracking <Cookie%20Tracking>`__**

The WebSocket Service is probably the most important among the Web
services provided by the `Web
Transport <Web%20Transport%20and%20Services>`__. It provides
WAMP-over-WebSocket transport services on a configurable HTTP path, so
serving WAMP clients can be mixed with other Web services, and run on
one network port.

    The difference between the WebSocket Service here, and the
    `WebSocket Transport <WebSocket%20Transport>`__ is that the latter
    transport is **only** able to serve WAMP-over-WebSocket and nothing
    else, whereas the WAMP-over-WebSocket transport here can be combined
    with other Web services all running on one port under the umbrella
    of a `Web Transport <Web%20Transport%20and%20Services>`__.

Configuration
-------------

To configure a WebSocket Service, attach a dictionary element to a path
in your `Web transport <Web%20Transport%20and%20Services>`__:

Example
-------

The Crossbar.io node configuration generated by default already contains
an example for the WebSocket Service.

Just create a new Crossbar.io node

::

    mkdir ~/mynode
    cd ~/mynode
    crossbar init

This will generate a node configuration
``~/mynode/.crossbar/config.json`` with this contents (we only show part
of the contents):

.. code:: json

    {
       "workers": [
          {
             "type": "router",
             "transports": [
                {
                   "type": "web",
                   "paths": {
                      "/": {
                         "type": "static",
                         "directory": ".."
                      },
                      "ws": {
                         "type": "websocket"
                      }
                   }
                }
             ]
          }
       ]
    }

This will run a WebSocket Service on the path ``/ws``. All other paths
are served by the service configured for the root path ``/``, which in
this case is just serving the ``~/mynode`` directory.

The WebSocket transport as used above (as a subpath service) has all the
parameters and options like for a standalone WebSocket transport. The
only exception is **endpoint**, which must be provided with standalone
WebSocket transport, but which must not be specified when running as a
subpath service (since the endpoint is already configured on the base
Web transport).

If present, the URL in the WebSocket part of the configuration MUST
include the path component. In the above, since the WebSocket transport
runs on the path **/ws**, the correct URL is **ws://localhost:8080/ws**.
A standalone WebSocket transport's URL would have used
**ws://localhost:8080**.
