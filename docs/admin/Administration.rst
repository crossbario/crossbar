Administration Manual
=====================

This is the Crossbar.io **Administration Manual**. The documentation
here discusses the configuration and administration of the different
features that come with Crossbar.io.

    For developers, we provide a `Programming
    Guide <Programming%20Guide>`__ that provides documentation about
    programming aspects related to Crossbar.io.
