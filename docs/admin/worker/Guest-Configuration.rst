Guest Configuration
===================

**Guest workers** are worker processes spawned by Crossbar.io which
runapplication components written in languages other than Python (the
language which Crossbar.io is written in), or in Python 3.x (Crossbar.io
is currently on Python 2.7).

This makes deployment of WAMP applications easier, since you can start
an entire application backend just by starting Crossbar.io.

Guest workers are configured under ``workers``, as type ``guest``.

For example, here is a **Guest Worker** configuration which starts a
JavaScript component using Node.js:

.. code:: javascript

    {
       "type": "guest",
       "executable": "node",
       "arguments": ["hello.js"],
       "options": {
          "workdir": "../node",
          "watch": {
             "directories": ["../node"],
             "action": "restart"
          }
       }
    }

Executable Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The argument ``executable`` provides the path to the executable that
Crossbar.io uses when starting the worker.

Crossbar.io first parses this as an absolute path as well as a relative
path (relative to the ``workdir`` in ``options``). If no executable is
found there, then it considers it an environment variable and attempts
to use the path stored there.

    **Note**: Python defaults to unbuffered stdout, so you probably want
    to `pass the -u
    option <https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-u>`__
    when configuring Python guest workers.
