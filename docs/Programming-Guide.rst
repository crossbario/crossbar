Programming Guide
=================

Programming WAMP application components is tied to the particular client
library you're using. The `Autobahn <https://crossbar.io/autobahn/>`__ family of WAMP client
libraries is provided by us, whereas you can find more WAMP client
libraries `here <http://wamp.ws/implementations/#libraries>`__.

We also operate a public :doc:`Crossbar.io Demo Instance <../Demo-Instance>`
and offer a range of materials for `IoT devices, components and
applications <http://crossbario.com/iotcookbook>`__.

    For administrators, we provide a :doc:`Administration Manual <Administration>` that provides documentation about
    administration aspects related to Crossbar.io.

The following introduces different areas of WAMP application programming
